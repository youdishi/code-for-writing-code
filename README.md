# code-for-writing-code
Goal:I want to create a small program which can write some code on its own and I only need to tell the program my requirements. 
For example, if I want to find all the prime numbers within 100, this program can study the concept of prime numbers and know the limit on its own, knowing what functions to use and what the right sentence order is. 

//This program is just a idea and the followings are my initial thoughts of making it.
How to do it:
1.Make it understand the users' requirements.
2.Form fake code
3.Turn it into real code
4.Test the code it writes and know how to correct.

Actually, I am not a skilled programmer. It is just a idea suddenly appeared without careful consideration.
Any comments or suggestions will be welcomed.
